# LEVEL GOAL

My buddy Blaise told me he learned about this cool cipher invented by a guy also named Blaise! Can you figure out what it says? Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 11281.

# HINTS

(1) There are tools that make this easy. (2) This cipher was NOT invented by Pascal

# SOLUTION

1. Go to https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher
2. Use statistical analysis to get the key
3. Decrypt ciphertext - every paragraph may have different keys (at least the first and third did!)

# FLAG
