# LEVEL GOAL

Can you find the flag encoded inside this image [1] ? You can also find the file in /problems/loadsomebits_4_7be73021cd0c9c84b08937323b0d6ae1 on the shell server.

# HINTS

(1) Look through the Least Significant Bits for the image (2) If you interpret a binary sequence (seq) as ascii and then try interpreting the same binary sequence from an offset of 1 (seq[1:]) as ascii do you get something similar or completely different?

# SOLUTION

1. Get a binary dump of the image using xxd -b

2. List out the LSB sequence line by line - this needs automation, I didn't find any suitable

3. Got this: and then convert it to string
