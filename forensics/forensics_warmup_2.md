# LEVEL GOAL

Hmm for some reason I can't open this PNG [1] ? Any ideas?

# HINTS

(1) How do operating systems know what kind of file it is? (It's not just the ending! (2) Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

# SOLUTION

The flag is in the image's metadata. I used https://metapicz.com/#landing as the metadata viewer tool. Just upload the image and tool will do the rest.

# FLAG

picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}
